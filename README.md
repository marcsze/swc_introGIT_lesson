# Intro to GitHub Lesson Plan
**Originally designed for a SWC session from August 17th - August 18th**

### Preamble

This repository contains all the material needed as well as a description and walkthrough of all the different topics that will be covered during the session.

### Obtaining Example Data Set

There shouldn't be any need to get data since it will all be generated during the lesson. 

### Automated Version Control

* The information for this lesson can be found [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics/). 

* Main Question
  * Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve the excellent version of your conclusion? Is it even possible? Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper? If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the Track Changes option? Do you have a history of those changes?

* At the end of the lesson (after the question) can show an example of version control with the following [repo for obesity](https://github.com/SchlossLab/Sze_Obesity_mBio_2016/commits/master). This will help to illustrate what it looks like in real life before we delve into the example problems and getting used to using the system.
